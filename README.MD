**Pianoo Mate** is a JavaScript project that enables piano fans to play and practice the instrument on a web browser. The project utilizes event listeners to trigger the playing of piano notes through the use of keyboard keys or by clicking on the virtual piano keys displayed on the web app. The app also includes a feature to prevent multiple triggering of sounds when a key is held down, and a function to highlight the played note on the virtual piano keyboard. With its user-friendly interface and responsive design, Pianoo Mate is a great tool for beginners and experienced players alike to enhance their piano playing skills.
